# Trello-Quora-Api

In this project, we have developed REST API endpoints of various functionalities required for a website (similar to Quora). In order to observe the functionality of the endpoints, user needs to use the Swagger user interface and store the data in the PostgreSQL database. The project has been implemented using Java Persistence API (JPA).

The authentication functionality is implemented in such a way that the API endpoints are accessible only when a user successfully logs in to the endpoint '/user/signin'.
